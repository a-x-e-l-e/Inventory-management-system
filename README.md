# Inventory management system

Like the heading might suggest, this is a simple inventory management system project, which includes database management, account management, and user management for the admin (without forgetting pretty visuals, of course).

# About the project

One can think of inventory as some kind of a warehouse with boxes stacked on top of each other, all of which contain something. Perhaps the boxes are actual boxes or imaginary ones, and perhaps the content of the boxes is something physical, or perhaps it’s an entry in a database. A rotating cube – a box – serves as the main element of the pages for this reason, as it symbolizes the very thing this project was meant to be used for: managing the inventory – a stack of boxes. 

# Requirements 

- Python 3.12 or newer
- Flask 3.0 or newer
- Flask-Login 0.6.3 or newer
- Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.1.1 or newer

# How to use the app

After installing all the required packages, simply run the main.py file, and follow the instructions given to you in your terminal window.

After launching the app, and navigating to the address given to you in the terminal, you will see a login page. Use the default admin username and password:
username: admin
password: adminpassword999
Change the default password after logging in by opening the menu in the upper left corner, and click "Tili". Enter the default password, and then choose a password you'd like. 

After that, you can navigate to the "Selaa" page through the menu, and try creating some new items to test the app.

# Demos of the appearance of the app:

This is the main view which the user sees when they successfully log in. (Sample data in the video's database view.)

And this is what the user sees when moving from one page to another, for example when logging out.
